## 💡 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀:-

✨ We can see that 𝗔𝗗𝗥 remains consistent throughout 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸𝗱𝗮𝘆 and 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 hence we can conclude there is no dynamic pricing present. Management can initiate the concept of Dynamic Pricing gaining Maximum Realization %.

✨ One can observe by dashboard that 𝗢𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗰𝘆 % stands above 50% throughout all weeks hence we can conclude that Hotel Chains are gaining good amount of customers.

✨ Overall 𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 is found to be 3.62 which is satisfactory, but focus should be there on increasing it.

✨ We can see a direct relationship between 𝗔𝘃𝗴 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 and 𝗢𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗰𝘆 %, hotel chains which are having less Occ% are providing less ratings hence focus should be on them.

✨ 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗺𝘆𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗽 and others platform are generating more revenue than other booking platforms.
